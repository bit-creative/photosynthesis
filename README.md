# Photosynthesis React UI Kit 
React UI components made with styled-components for Electron applications

## Inspiration 

[Photon](http://photonkit.com/) No longer maintained component library for Electron applications with a native Mac OS look

[react-photonkit](https://github.com/react-photonkit/react-photonkit) Also no longer maintained. This was the React implementation of the above library


My initial goal was simply to port the styles directly over to styled components and be done. However I quickly became aware I wasn't satisfied with the use of React in the second project. 
What I clearly needed to do was not simply port the styles, but build on top and dare I say...:woman_shrugging: *lighten* the electron development experience. I guess it's kind of a .... photosynthesis of the previous efforts. (see what I did there :clap: :clap::clap:
